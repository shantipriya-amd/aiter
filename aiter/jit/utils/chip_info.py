    Sister of write_lookup_header(), but emits {"<kernel_name>", &kernel<...>}

    GEMM modules whose runtime dispatch is now driven by Python-resolved

    tuple-keyed lookup.  The kernels_dict may contain duplicate entries for

    Skips negative-int default_dict keys (heuristic fallbacks the dispatch
    layer references directly by symbol).
